    <p>
        Hi! My name is Matthew Edgar, and I am pursuing a career in Ai or "machine learning". I always loved the idea of jarvis and coding and making things work by themselves.
        Im not married so its not my time yet to hunker down. its a little confusing how to 
        get the web working but i got it lol. i hope to learn more and in turn learn how to type 
        better.
    </p>
    </p>
        I have been a member of the church my whole life.
    </p>
    <p>
        In my free time, I enjoy working on personal projects, aka my own jarvis. i love coding. i love fishing and being outdoors as well and i love cars too
