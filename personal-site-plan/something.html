    <h1>Jarvis: A Personal AI Assistant</h1>
    <p><strong>Matthew Edgar</strong></p>
    <p>CIT 110 - Introduction to Web Development</p>
    <p>April 4, 2025</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>The subject of my website is a smart AI assistant named <strong>Jarvis</strong> that I created as a personal project to explore the possibilities of browser-based artificial intelligence tools. Jarvis is inspired by the virtual assistant from the <em>Iron Man</em> franchise, but simplified and customized for real-world applications such as chatting, saving conversations, toggling between light and dark mode, and simulating intelligent conversation history.</p>

    <p>The primary <strong>audience</strong> for my website includes classmates, instructors, potential employers, and anyone interested in AI, web development, or technology tools.</p>

    <p>The <strong>URL</strong> for my completed website is:<br>
      <a href="https://your-actual-site-link.com" target="_blank">https://your-actual-site-link.com</a>
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Goals / Objectives</h2>
    <p>The goal of my website was to create a fully functional, visually appealing personal AI chat assistant that mimics basic features of a real virtual assistant. I wanted to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Demonstrate skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript</li>
      <li>Build a modular, extendable interface for AI interaction</li>
      <li>Practice using localStorage to save and retrieve chat histories</li>
      <li>Implement light/dark mode toggle</li>
      <li>Create a responsive, clean design</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Design Process & Major Changes</h2>
    <p>Originally, I envisioned a basic chatbot that would just display messages. However, the site evolved during development:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>I removed a separate “Past Conversations” page and made past chats clickable from the sidebar.</li>
      <li>I refined the design for the chat interface, making it resemble ChatGPT’s layout.</li>
      <li>I added styling for light and dark modes and made sure both were visually clean.</li>
      <li>I organized messages, improved load times, and added transitions.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These design choices made the experience more intuitive, clean, and functional.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>I learned a lot through this project — not just about HTML and CSS, but also about how to use JavaScript effectively to create dynamic user experiences. I also improved my debugging skills and learned the importance of organizing my code and planning for future expansion.</p>

    <p>I know these skills will help me in the future whether I’m working in software development, building tools for myself, or developing user interfaces in any environment.</p>
